      <h1>What's happening?</h1>
      <p>Each hackday has it own topic. You can sign up with your friends or alone and build small teams at the location. After a quick introduction of the staff you're ready to go to design and program a nice app about the given topic. You or your team has 24 hours to get the app running or at least a prototype of it.</p>
      <p>If the time is over, everyone can choose freely to present his app.</p>
